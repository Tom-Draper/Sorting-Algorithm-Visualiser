# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser

This is a simple project to build upon the basics of Python and consolidate my knowledge of the Turtle module. The program takes a list of items and displays each items change of index and prograssion through the sorting algorithm in the form of a line. This project was heavily inspired by the cover art of Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths.

Project Aims:
Maintain and expand my knowledge of Python.
Expand my knowledge of the turtle module.

What I Learned:
How to display a series of changes made together at once using turtle.tracer
Arrived by myself at a method of converting list index positions and pass numbers to coordnates on a screen using multiplier constants.
